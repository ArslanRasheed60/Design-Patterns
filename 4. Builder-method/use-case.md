# Builder Pattern Use Cases

The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. Here are the most common and practical use cases for the Builder pattern with real-world examples:

## 1. Complex Object Construction
- Building objects with many optional attributes
  - Example: `StringBuilder` class in Java for efficient string manipulation
- Creating objects with varying configurations
  - Example: `DocumentBuilderFactory` in Java for creating XML documents
- Constructing objects with complex initialization
  - Example: `AlertDialog.Builder` in Android for creating dialog boxes

## 2. Product Configuration
- Configuring customizable products
  - Example: `PizzaBuilder` in food ordering systems for creating custom pizzas
- Building vehicle configurations
  - Example: `CarBuilder` in automotive websites for customizing car features
- Creating meal combinations
  - Example: `MealBuilder` in restaurant apps for combo meals

## 3. UI Component Construction
- Building complex forms
  - Example: `FormBuilder` in web frameworks for dynamic form generation
- Creating dialog boxes
  - Example: `DialogBuilder` in desktop applications
- Constructing email templates
  - Example: `EmailBuilder` for creating HTML email templates

## 4. Query Construction
- Building complex database queries
  - Example: `QueryBuilder` in ORMs like Hibernate
- Creating API requests
  - Example: `RequestBuilder` in HTTP clients like Retrofit
- Constructing search criteria
  - Example: `SearchBuilder` in search engines
