# Adapter Pattern Use Cases

The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. Here are the most practical real-world use cases:

## 1. Payment Gateway Integration
- Unified payment processing
  - Example: Creating a single payment interface that works with Stripe, PayPal, and Square
- Currency conversion
  - Example: Adapting different currency formats and exchange rate providers
- Payment method abstraction
  - Example: Supporting credit cards, digital wallets, and bank transfers through one API

## 2. Legacy System Integration
- Modernizing old systems
  - Example: Wrapping a legacy SOAP service with a modern REST API
- Database connectivity
  - Example: Using an ORM to work with different database systems (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
- File format conversion
  - Example: Converting between CSV, Excel, and JSON for data imports/exports

## 3. Authentication Services
- Multiple OAuth providers
  - Example: Supporting login with Google, Facebook, and GitHub using a single interface
- Authentication methods
  - Example: Unifying password, API key, and JWT token authentication
- Single Sign-On (SSO)
  - Example: Integrating with enterprise identity providers like Okta or Azure AD

## 4. Cloud Storage
- Multi-cloud file operations
  - Example: Using the same code to work with AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob
- File format adaptation
  - Example: Automatically converting images to different formats on upload
- Access control
  - Example: Normalizing permissions across different cloud providers

## 5. Notification Systems
- Third-party service integration
  - Example: Adapting different email providers (SendGrid, Mailchimp, AWS SES) to a common interface
- Protocol adaptation
  - Example: Converting between SMTP, HTTP, and WebSocket protocols for different notification services
- Response normalization
  - Example: Standardizing error responses and delivery statuses across different providers

## 6. API Versioning
- Backward compatibility
  - Example: Making v2 API endpoints work with clients expecting v1 responses
- Response formatting
  - Example: Supporting both JSON and XML responses from the same endpoint
- Request transformation
  - Example: Converting between different query parameter formats
